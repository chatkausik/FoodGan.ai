# FoodGan.ai
App to classify the Food, identifies ingredients, calories and recommend similar type food based on health conditions.

# Introduction
This project was completed by Kausik Chattapadhyay. This article details how to create a web and mobile app image classifier and is deep-learning-language agnostic. 

FoodGan.ai app will capture food images and perform the following tasks :
1. Identify the Food.
2. Identify Ingredients and total calories.
3. Recommend similar food based on user health conditions.

Our example uses the fastai library, but a model weights file from any deep learning library can be used to create a web and mobile app using our methods.

# Summary
The project covers:

1. training a deep learning model for food images using fastai
2. deploying a web app using Heroku and Flask
3. deploying a mobile app

Our Heroku web app is 

# Our mobile apps are available:

iOS Apple store: 
Android Google Play:
